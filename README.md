# Numerical Algorithms and Mathematical Tools

This repository contains C++ implementations of several numerical and mathematical algorithms.

## Files

* `FAD2.cpp`: Implements a class for **Automatic Differentiation (FAD)** to compute first and second derivatives of multivariate functions.

* `SOR.cpp`: Implements the **Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)** method for solving banded linear systems.

* `gauss.cpp`: Solves linear equations using **Gaussian Elimination** and **Iterative Refinement**.

* `geomSeq.cpp`: Finds the three terms of a geometric sequence given their product and sum.

* `rootFinder.cpp`: A hybrid algorithm for finding roots, combining the **Bisection** and **Secant** methods.

## Dependencies

* `function.h`: Required by `FAD2.cpp`.

* `vectalg.h`: Required by `gauss.cpp`.
